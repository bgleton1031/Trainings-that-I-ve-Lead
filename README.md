# Trainings that I've Lead

Hereâ€™s a collection of trainings I've led. Being married to a veteran teacher has taught me all about different learning styles, and Iâ€™ve worked to accommodate them in these sessions. I mix easy-to-understand concepts with real-life examplesâ€”and a dash of comedy and personalityâ€”to make sure what Iâ€™m teaching really sticks. Turns out, itâ€™s not just in one ear and out the otherâ€”I really do listen to my wife! ðŸ¤£ Enjoy!

<h2>ðŸ¤“ Discovering Business Principles (LIVE PODCAST PANELIST DISCUSSION)</h2>
Being a podcaster of a business podcast, I organized a live podcast recording with a few friends of mine (and yes, that one guy looks just like me because that's my twin brother) and we discussed principles of business. On the panel, I had a mental strength coach and owner of a gym, a digital marketing and AI expert, and a business consultant/CPA to answer questions from the audience and some burning questions I had myself.
